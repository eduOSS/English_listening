  low-intermediate  
  I've been interested in the cultures of Japan, mainland China, and Taiwan for years, and speak **low-intermediate** Japanese and Mandarin (though my Japanese would require some review). I want to master both languages.[source](http://www.quora.com/Should-I-teach-English-in-Japan-mainland-China-or-Taiwan)
